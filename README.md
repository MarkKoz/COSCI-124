### Exercise 04 - Distance Traveled
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

<p align="center"><code>distance = speed Ã— time</code></p>

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance
travelled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a
vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has travelled. It should
then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour
of that time period. Here is an example of the desired output:

`What is the speed of the vehicle in mph?` **40** <kbd>Enter</kbd><br/>
`How many hours has it traveled?` **3** <kbd>Enter</kbd>

| Hour | Distance Traveled |
|------|------------------:|
| 1    | 40                |
| 2    | 80                |
| 3    | 120               |

### Exercise 08 - Sum of Numbers
Write a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of positive
numbers. The user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the
series. After all the positive numbers have been entered, the program should
display their sum.
