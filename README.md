### Exercise 06 - Average of Numbers
Assume that a file containing a series of integers is named `numbers.txt` and
exists on the computer’s disk. Write a program that calculates the average of
all the numbers stored in the file.

### Exercise 09 - Exception Handling
Modify the program that you wrote for Exercise 6 so it handles the following
exceptions:
* It should handle any IOError exceptions that are raised when the file is
opened and data is read from it.
* It should handle any ValueError exceptions that are raised when the items that
are read from the file are converted to a number.
