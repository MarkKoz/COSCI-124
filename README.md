### Exercise 08 - Sentence Capitalizer
Write a program with a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns
a copy of the string with the first character of each sentence capitalized. For
instance, if the argument is

> hello. my name is Joe. what is your name?

the function should return the string

> Hello. My name is Joe. What is your name?

The program should let the user enter a string and then pass it to the function.
The modified string should be displayed.

### Exercise 09 - Vowels and Consonants
Write a program with a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns
the number of vowels that the string contains. The application should have
another function that accepts a string as an argument and returns the number of
consonants that the string contains. The application should let the user enter a
string and should display the number of vowels and the number of consonants it
contains.

### Exercise 10 - Most Frequent Character
Write a program that lets the user enter a string and displays the character
that appears most frequently in the string.

### Exercise 11 - Word Separator
Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are
run together but the first character of each word is uppercase. Convert the
sentence to a string in which the words are separated by spaces and only the
first word starts with an uppercase letter. For example the string

> StopAndSmellTheRoses.

would be converted to

> Stop and smell the roses.

### Exercise 12 - Pig Latin
Write a program that accepts a sentence as input and converts each word to
"Pig Latin." In one version, to convert a word to Pig Latin you remove the first
letter and place that letter at the end of the word. Then you append the string
"ay" to the word. Here is an example:

English:
> I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT

Pig Latin:
> IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY
