### Exercise 05 - Property Tax
A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is
60 percent of the property’s actual value. For example, if an acre of land is
valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 72¢
for each $100 of the assessment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000
will be $43.20. Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of
property and displays the assessment value and property tax.

### Exercise 08 - Paint Job Estimator
A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space,
one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company
charges $35.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that asks the user to enter
the square feet of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per
gallon. The program should display the following data:

* The number of gallons of paint required
* The hours of labor required
* The cost of the paint
* The labor charges
* The total cost of the paint job
