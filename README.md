### Exercise 04 - Roman Numerals
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 1
through 10. The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number.
If the number is outside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display
an error message. The following table shows the Roman numerals for the numbers
1 through 10:

| Number | Roman Numeral |
|--------|:-------------:|
| 1      | I             |
| 2      | II            |
| 3      | III           |
| 4      | IV            |
| 5      | V             |
| 6      | VI            |
| 7      | VII           |
| 8      | VIII          |
| 9      | IX            |
| 10     | X             |

### Exercise 12 - Software Sales
A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are
given according to the following table:

| Quantity | Discount |
|----------|:--------:|
| 10–19    | 10%      |
| 20–49    | 20%      |
| 50–99    | 30%      |
| 100+     | 40%      |

Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased.
The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the
total amount of the purchase after the discount.
