### Exercise 01 - Course Information
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room
numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The dictionary should have the
following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (key) | Room Number (value) |
|---------------------|:-------------------:|
| CS101               | 3004                |
| CS102               | 4501                |
| CS103               | 6755                |
| NT110               | 1244                |
| CM241               | 1411                |

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the
names of the instructors that teach each course. The dictionary should have the
following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (key) | Instructor (value) |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| CS101               | Haynes             |
| CS102               | Alvarado           |
| CS103               | Rich               |
| NT110               | Burke              |
| CM241               | Lee                |

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the
meeting times of each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value
pairs:

| Course Number (key) | Meeting Time (value) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| CS101               | 8:00 a.m.            |
| CS102               | 9:00 a.m.            |
| CS103               | 10:00 a.m.           |
| NT110               | 11:00 a.m.           |
| CM241               | 1:00 p.m.            |

The program should let the user enter a course number, and then it should
display the course’s room number, instructor, and meeting time.

### Exercise 02 - Capital Quiz
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys and
their capitals as values. (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and
their capitals.) The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying
the name of a state and asking the user to enter that state’s capital. The
program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.
(As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of
countries and their capitals.)
