### Exercise 04 - Distance Traveled
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

<p align="center"><code>distance = speed Ã— time</code></p>

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance
travelled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a
vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has travelled. It should
then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour
of that time period. Here is an example of the desired output:

`What is the speed of the vehicle in mph?` **40** <kbd>Enter</kbd><br/>
`How many hours has it traveled?` **3** <kbd>Enter</kbd>

| Hour | Distance Traveled |
|------|------------------:|
| 1    | 40                |
| 2    | 80                |
| 3    | 120               |

### Exercise 12 - Population
Write a program that predicts the approximate size of a population of organisms.
The application should use text boxes to allow the user to enter the starting
number of organisms, the average daily population increase (as a percentage),
and the number of days the organisms will be left to multiply. For example,
assume the user enters the following values:

Starting number of organisms: 2<br/>
Average daily increase: 30%<br/>
Number of days to multiply: 10<br/>

The program should display the following table of data:

| Day Approximate | Population |
|-----------------|------------|
| 1               | 2          |
| 2               | 2.6        |
| 3               | 3.38       |
| 4               | 4.394      |
| 5               | 5.7122     |
| 6               | 7.42586    |
| 7               | 9.653619   |
| 8               | 12.5497    |
| 9               | 16.31462   |
| 10              | 21.209     |
